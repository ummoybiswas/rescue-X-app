application.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser">body-parser</a> parses incoming request
bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the <em>req.body</em>
property. You need this so you can handle POST requests.</li>

application.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb">mongodb</a> is the official NodeJS driver

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/async">async</a> is a utility for dealing with
asynchronous code in NodeJS. It helps you avoid callback hell.</li>
